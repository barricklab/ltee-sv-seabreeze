# Seabreeze
Seabreeze is an automate pipeline for structural variant analysis from bacterial resequencing experiments.
Seabreeze is currently under development as I migrate and clean the workflow first described in the [LTEE-SV](https://github.com/ira-zibbu/LTEE-SV) project repo.

Seabreeze uses snakemake to neatly manage input/output and conda env dependencies.
