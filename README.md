_seabreeze_ is a tool for the comprehensive analysis of structural variant (SVs) mutations in bacterial resequencing experiments. _seabreeze_ automates and unites several analyses into a single, easy-to-use pipeline. For specified pairs of bacterial genomes, it can:

- Compute size difference between genomes
- Predict the location of insertion sequences
- Predict SVs (inversions, deletions, translocations, duplications)
- Generate intuitive synteny plots to visualise SVs
- Analyse the effect of SVs on the balance of the two replichores
- Predict the putative mechanism of inversions and deletions
- Annotate the genes contained in the mutated regions

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://barricklab.github.io/seabreeze) for information on installation and usage.
